📌 Digi-Physi Drumkit & Metronome
An interactive musical instrument combining a digital drumkit and a metronome using IoT sensors.

This project simulates a drumkit experience using:
🥁 Piezo sensor – Detects drum hits (snare sound).
🥁 Ultrasonic sensor – Detects hand gestures to trigger a cymbal sound.
🎵 Metronome – Provides a steady rhythm with an LED and speaker.

🔧 Tech Stack: Arduino (ESP32), C++, sensors, and real-time sound generation.
